        <p>
          Bryant earned national recognition during a spectacular high school
          career at Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, located in the
          Philadelphia suburb of Lower Merion. He played on the varsity
          basketball team as a freshman. Bryant became the first freshman in
          decades to start for Lower Merion's varsity team, but the team
          finished with a 4–20 record. The following three years, the Aces
          compiled a 77–13 record, with Bryant playing all five positions.
          During his junior year, he averaged 31.1 points, 10.4 rebounds, and
          5.2 assists and was named Pennsylvania Player of the Year while also
          earning a fourth-team Parade All-American nomination, attracting
          attention from college recruiters in the process. Duke, Michigan,
          North Carolina and Villanova were at the top of his list. However,
          after high schooler Kevin Garnett went in the first round of the 1995
          NBA draft, Bryant also began contemplating going directly to the pros.

          Bryant received several awards for his outstanding performance during
          his senior year at Lower Merion. These included being named Naismith
          High School Player of the Year, Gatorade Men's National Basketball
          Player of the Year, a McDonald's All-American, a first-team Parade
          All-American and a USA Today All-USA First Team player. Bryant's
          varsity coach, Greg Downer, commented that he was "a complete player
          who dominates" and praised his work ethic, even as the team's top
          player. In 1996, Bryant took R&B singer Brandy to his senior prom.
          Ultimately, the 17-year-old Bryant made the decision to go directly
          into the NBA, becoming only the sixth player in NBA history to do so.
          Bryant's news was met with a lot of publicity at a time when
          prep-to-pro NBA players were not very common (Garnett being the only
          exception in 20 years). His basketball skills and SAT score of 1080
          would have ensured admission to any college he chose, but he did not
          officially visit any campuses. In 2012, Bryant was honored as one of
          the 35 Greatest McDonald's All-Americans.

        <h2>The Champion</h2>
        <p>
          Bryant's fortunes would improve when Phil Jackson took over as coach
          of the Lakers in 1999. After years of steady improvement, Bryant
          became one of the premier shooting guards in the league, earning
          appearances in the league's All-NBA, All-Star, and All-Defensive
          teams. The Lakers became championship contenders behind the
          center-guard combination of Bryant and O'Neal. Jackson utilized the
          triangle offense that he implemented to win six championships with the
          Chicago Bulls; this offense would help both Bryant and O'Neal rise to
          the elite class of the NBA. Three championships were won consecutively
          in 2000, 2001, and 2002, further cementing this view.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the 2001–02 season, Bryant played 80 games for the first time in
          his career. On January 14, 2002, Bryant recorded a then career-high 56
          points to go along with five rebounds and four assists in a 120–81 win
          over the visiting Memphis Grizzlies. He continued his all-round play
          by averaging 25.2 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.5 assists per game.
          Bryant also had a career-high 46.9% shooting and once again led his
          team in assists. He claimed his first All-Star MVP trophy after a
          31-point performance in Philadelphia when he was loudly booed by fans
          as they had throughout the game, stemming from his earlier comment to
          a 76ers heckler during the Finals that the Lakers were "going to cut
          your hearts out". While making the All-NBA Defensive team again,
          Bryant was also named to the All-NBA First Team for the first time in
          his career. The Lakers won 58 games that year and finished second in
          the Pacific Division behind in-state rival Sacramento Kings. Bryant
          was suspended one game after he punched Reggie Miller of the Indiana
          Pacers after the Lakers' March 1, 2002 victory over the Pacers.

        <p>
          In 2018, Bryant became the first African-American to win the Academy
          Award for Best Animated Short Film and the first former professional
          athlete to be nominated and to win an Academy Award in any category
          for his film Dear Basketball. The film also won the Annie Award for
          Best Animated Short Subject and a Sports Emmy Award. The film was
          produced by Bryant's production company, Granity Studios. In addition
          to future animation projects, he had been in talks with animator
          veteran Bruce Smith for the last six months before his death about
          starting his own animation studio.

          In high school, Bryant was a member of a rap group called CHEIZAW,
          named after the Chi Sah gang in the martial arts film Kid with the
          Golden Arm. The group was signed by Sony Entertainment, but the
          company's ultimate goal was to eliminate the group and have Bryant
          record on his own. The label wanted to capitalize on Bryant's youth
          and NBA fame. He performed at a 1997 concert by Sway & King Tech and
          recorded a verse for a remix of Brian McKnight's "Hold Me". Bryant
          even appeared on Lakers teammate O'Neal's Respect, starting the track
          "3 X's Dope", though Bryant's name was not listed on the credits.

          Sony pushed Bryant from his roots of underground hip hop into a more
          radio-friendly sound. His debut album, Visions, was scheduled to
          release in the spring of 2000. The first single, "K.O.B.E'", featured
          supermodel Tyra Banks singing the hook. The single debuted in January
          2000, and was performed at NBA All-Star Weekend that month; the song
          was not well received. Sony abandoned plans for the album, which was
          never released, and dropped Bryant later that year. The Sony president
          who originally signed Bryant had already left, and Bryant's other
          backers had mostly abandoned him. Afterward, Bryant co-founded an
          independent record label, Heads High Entertainment, but it folded
          within a year.In 1999, Bryant appeared on a remix of "Say My Name" by
          Destiny's Child on the Maxi single version of the song.

          was featured in Taiwanese singer Jay Chou's single, "The Heaven and
          Earth Challenge" (天地一鬥, pronounced "Tian Di Yi Dou"). The proceeds
          for downloads of both the single and ringtones were donated to
          impoverished schools for basketball facilities and equipment. The
          music video of the single also features Bryant. The song was also used
          by Sprite in its 2011 marketing campaign in China.
